# VIEH-GROUP
I created this encryption code under the internship opportunity I got by the VIEH Group.
I wrote my code in the c++ language in which I was confident to write my code. 
As we will execute the file the compiler will run it and will ask to enter the message to encrypt the file.
After the entering the message to be encrypted in the next step it will ask for the encryption key.
As here we are going to implement the symmetric key encryption so we have to enter the key by which later we will be able to decrypt the cypher text to get the original message.
After the encryption as we will agian execute the code it will again ask for two option whether we want to encrypt or decrypt the message, so as we have  already encrupted.
So this time we will decrypt the message.
Then it will ask to enter the cypher text we got after encryption.
We will enter the cypher text.
In the next step we will prompted to enter the key to decrypt the text by which we have encrypted the text earliar.
AS we will enter the key we will get the original message.
